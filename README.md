# module-pattern-variant
A playground to tinker with modular pattern adding controllers

# Installation:
Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To test installation open a console and input:

```node -v```

It should return version installed. Also ```npm``` is needed (it will be shipped together with node).

With a console pointing at this repository folder type:

```npm install```

After installation you can test the app with the command:

```npm run start```

Since this app uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) each change to local file will automatically restart server.
